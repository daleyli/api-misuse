\subsection{Key Ideas}
\label{sec:key-ideas}

From the above observations, we draw the following key ideas for our
approach.

\begin{key-idea}[Deep Learning for API usages]
We leverage Machine Learning to implicitly learn co-occurring API
elements in API usages. From the basis of the regularity of API
usages: the API elements regularly appearing together in API usages
have higher impact in establishing the correct API usages than the
less regular ones. Importantly, the learning-based direction helps
avoid the use of thresholds in either establishing the API usage
patterns or distinguishing between the misuses and the uncommon
usages, as in the mining-based API misuse detection approaches. We
could leverage the complete, compilable code using the libraries from
a large code corpus, in which all the API elements in use are known.

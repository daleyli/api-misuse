\subsection{Code Feature Representation Learning}
\label{sec:features}

An API element at a node in the AUG built from a method is represented
via a sequence of the sub-tokens. The sub-token granularity for source
code has been shown to have higher regularity than the token
level~\cite{icse20-methodname}. Each name of an API element at a node
is tokenized using CamelCase or Hungarian convention. Then, only
variables, methods, fields, and class' names are kept. The sub-tokens
with one character are removed to avoid noises.

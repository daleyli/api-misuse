\subsection{Code Feature Representation Learning}
\label{sec:features}

An API element at a node in the AUG built from a method is represented
via a sequence of the sub-tokens extracted from the node's
content. The sub-token granularity for source code has been shown to
have higher regularity than tokens~\cite{icse20-methodname}. Each name
of an API element at a node is tokenized using CamelCase or Hungarian
convention. Only variables, methods, fields, and class' names
are kept. The sub-tokens with one character are removed to avoid
noises. We then treat each sequence of sub-tokens as a sentence and
use a word embedding technique~\cite{glove2014} to build the vectors
for the sub-tokens.  The vector for the sequence of sub-tokens is used
for the node.

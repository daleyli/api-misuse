\section{Related Work}
\label{sec: related}

{\tool} is related to the line of work on API misuse detection.
The most prominent direction is mining API usage patterns
and leverage them to detect API misuses.

PRMiner is a misuse detector for C~\cite{LZ05}, which encodes usages
as the set of all function calls. It employs frequent-itemset mining
to find patterns. Violations here are strict subsets of a pattern that
occur at least ten times less frequently than the pattern. Colibri is
another misuse detector for C~\cite{L07}, which improves PRMiner using
Formal Concept Analysis~\cite{GW99}. Chronicler is a misuse detector
for C~\cite{RGJ07b}, that mines frequent call-precedence relations
from an inter-procedural control-flow graph, and detects missing
method calls.
